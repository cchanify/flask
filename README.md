###Run The Application###

Run the application using the flask command. From the terminal, tell Flask where to find your application, then run it in development mode. Remember, you should still be in the top-level flask-tutorial directory, not the flaskr package.

Development mode shows an interactive debugger whenever a page raises an exception, and restarts the server whenever you make changes to the code. You can leave it running and just reload the browser page as you follow the tutorial.

For Linux and Mac:
$ export FLASK_APP=flaskr
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run


###Before beginning work on project, activate the environment:###
$ . venv/bin/activate
